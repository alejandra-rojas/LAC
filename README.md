# The planet is your canvas - 1st stage static website

Informative and responsive website which served as a promotional platform for the contest 'The planet is your canvas 2002-2003' organized by the UN Environment program in LATAM. 

In addition to promoting the contest the website facilitated the submission of participant entries. The website was designed to be responsive, ensuring accessibility across various devices. The goal was to encourage participation and provide a user-friendly experience for individuals interested in submitting their entries.

Following the jury's selection of finalists from the received entries, the project transitioned into its second stage. The second stage involved the development of a dynamic web application where participants could vote for their preferred finalists.
